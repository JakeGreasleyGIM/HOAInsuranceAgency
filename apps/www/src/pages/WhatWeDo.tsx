            <p className="wwd-intro">
              HO-6 insurance is designed for condo unit owners. It covers personal property, unit improvements, personal liability, loss of use, and loss assessment coverage.
            </p>
            <h3 className="wwd-sub-heading">Why HO-6 Matters for Unit Owners in HOAs</h3>
            <p className="wwd-body">
              Unit owners are often surprised by association deductibles, special assessments, and coverage gaps between what the master policy covers and what they're responsible for. A properly structured HO-6 policy helps protect against these exposures.
